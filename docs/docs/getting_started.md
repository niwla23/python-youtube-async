This doc is a simple tutorial to show how to use this library to get data from YouTube DATA API.

You can get the whole description for YouTube API at [YouTube API Reference](https://google-developers.appspot.com/youtube/v3/docs/).

## Prerequisite

At the beginning. You need to create a [Google Project](https://console.cloud.google.com) by your google account.

Every new account has 12 project to cost.

## Create your project

Click the `Select a project-> NEW PROJECT` to create a new project to use our library.

Fill the basic info to finish created.

## Enable YouTube DATA API service

Once the project created, the browser will redirect project home page.

Then click the `≡≡` symbol on the left top. Chose the `APIs & Services` tab.

You will see follow info.

Then chose the ``YouTube DATA API`` item.

Then click the `ENABLE` blue button. Now the service has been activated.

## Create credentials

To use this API, you may need credentials. Click 'Create credentials' to get started.

You need to fill in some information to create credentials.

Just chose `YouTube DATA API v3`, `Other non-UI (e.g. cron job, daemon)` and `Public data`.

Then click the blue button `What credentials do I need?` to create.

Now you have generated one api key.

Use this key. You can retrieve public data for YouTube data by our library

```pythonregexp
In [1]: import pyyoutube
In [2]: api = pyyoutube.Api(api_key='your api key')
```

If you want to get some examples to see, check out the [examples](https://github.com/niwla23/python-youtube-async/tree/master/examples).

If you have an opens source application using python-youtube, send me a link, and I am very happy to add a link to it here.

But if you want to get user data by OAuth. You need create the credential for ``OAuth client ID``.

And get more info at next page for [Authorization](authorization.md).
